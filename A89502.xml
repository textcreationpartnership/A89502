            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Papi≈øts de≈øygnes again≈øt the Parliament and Citie of London, di≈øcovered.</head>
            <p>POpery is the nur≈øe of rebellion, and the mother of di≈øa≈øtrous di≈øcords; yea the very handmaid to di≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton for where Popi≈øh ≈øuper≈øtitions, and Romi≈øh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations are imbraced, there rebellion is commonly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: and where rebellion findes nutriment, there is a nece≈ø≈øary dependance of di≈øcords; and in a Kingdome where di≈øcords flouri≈øh, de≈øtruction cannot be farre off. The treacheries which the Papi≈øts have oftentimes moulded again≈øt this Realme, are numerous, and the plots circumvented daily again≈øt the purity of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are ≈øo various, that it had been confounded and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted long ≈øince in an ab≈øolute eradication of all ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, if ≈øo be divers ≈øtrong Pillars thereof had not ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ponderous ≈øtratagems intended again≈øt the ≈øame, by prodigious con≈øpiracies.</p>
            <p>The re≈øolution of the Papi≈øts have bin grounded often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and withall fully re≈øolved to ≈øubvert this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And the Ie≈øuites have alwayes diligently labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ≈øedulity, to ruinate the Realme. But both have been plotting alwayes the ≈øubver≈øion of the Parliament, if ≈øo be they could perfect their minds in any wi≈øe. But
<pb facs="tcp:126055:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 9 -->(alas!) the ≈øage iudgements of the Parliament are ≈øo pregnant, and the eye of their apprehenti≈øe intellect is to acute, that it can ea≈øily dive into the hiddene≈øt vault of their ≈øecrete≈øt plot and con≈øpiracie. For their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-guided mindes are taught by the ≈øupreame Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of all wi≈øedome: therefore what≈øoever is pretended again≈øt them, is like mi≈øts and fogges, that when they ari≈øe, ≈øeeme to ob≈øcure and oppo≈øe the Sunne: but at its fir≈øt appearance it di≈ø≈øipate them all; Even ≈øo the plots which the Papi≈øts pretend again≈øt our Parliament, are nullified as ea≈øily at the ≈øplendent and glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the irillu≈øtrious Councels.</p>
            <p>But le≈øt I ≈øhould deviate from my purpo≈øe, I will in ≈øome manner relate the intended treacherie which the Papi≈øts had in tended again≈øt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Many of the Ie≈øuites, and other Recu≈øants, knowing that the Parliament was tranferred into London, fir≈øt at Guild Hall, and afterwards at Grocers Hall, did convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their hell-nouri≈øhed Councels together, ≈øtriving to nur≈øe and foment ≈øome plot again≈øt them at their next returne unto We≈øtmin≈øter. Thus having ≈øo opportune a time, they moulded a con≈øpiracie; but they could not get the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion againe of the Cellar: ≈øo that by this meanes they could not equalize the Gun-powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon plot. But they were re≈øolved to provide a ≈øudden Army, and great munition of Military affaires, that when as the Parliament ≈øhould returne to We≈øtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter Hal againe, they would violently ru≈øh in upon them.</p>
            <p>This nefarious con≈øpiracie of theirs was di≈øcovered by a Letter ≈øent from L. M. a Ie≈øuite, to R. C. a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh Lord, and was found by a Gentleman neere White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.
<pb facs="tcp:126055:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 9 -->This Letter did containe many prodigious things included in it, ob≈øcurely mentioning of ≈øome private treachery, which was intended again≈øt the Parliament and Citie of London, and did give the Lord notice to bee ab≈øent at ≈øuch a time; when the plot was to bee delivered. But report hereof being immediatly ≈øent to the Committee, great watch was appointed to attend on both ≈øides of the Parliament Hou≈øe, and carefull ≈øearch about the hou≈øe, and the Cellar thereof.</p>
            <p>But (alas!) how all their determinated Councels were di≈øanulled, and how all their inventions were fru≈øtrated: for the Parliament them≈øelves did ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ≈øome private treachery among≈øt the Papi≈øts, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented again≈øt them: therefore they de≈øired the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bands to guard them to the Hou≈øe. The Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men proffred ten thou≈øand of them in Arms to guard them downe by water. And hereupon having pre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Petition to both, it was accordingly granted. Thus the Parliament was conducted with irre≈øi≈øtable forces; and maugre all the intents of the Romi≈øh Recu≈øants re≈øolutions, they returned to We≈øtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter in great pompe, ≈øufety, peace and tranquility to both hou≈øes, with the plau≈øible acclamations of the people.</p>
            <p>But the Papi≈øts had not onely intended their plot again≈øt the Parliament, but al≈øo, again≈øt London: Whereupon the Citizens, having great ≈øu≈øpition thereof, doe watch day and night in defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
            <p>They mu≈øt have ≈øtrong forces that are re≈øolved to ≈øubvert a Citie ≈øo great, and, ≈øo ≈øtrong, and ≈øo well
<pb facs="tcp:126055:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 10 -->fortified as <hi>London</hi> is: for otherwi≈øe they will ≈øeeme but as a Boy to a Giant, or a Pigmy to <hi>Heroides.</hi> They may proceed in their Con≈øpiracies, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to little effect: for there is a divine providence that ≈øees their wicked and nafarious machinations, who will never permit his people that tru≈øt in him, to bee ≈øubverted by ≈øuch trayterous de≈øignes. The Kings Maie≈øty perceiving the City in ≈øuch tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous di≈øcords, and di≈ø≈øentions, went la≈øt Munday to Hampton Court, with the Queen, Prince, and all his royall Off-≈øpring. Divers cau≈øes did induce him thereunto: fir≈øt being oppo≈øed in his Maie≈øties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure by the Hou≈øe of Commons, concerning Ma≈øter <hi>Pym,</hi> and other Parliament men, who were impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of High Trea≈øon: but it was denyed by the Hou≈øe, who delivered them≈øelves as Re≈øpon≈øall for tho≈øe Members, who were accu≈øed. The Kings Maie≈øty having in his owne royall Per≈øon once or twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them of the Hou≈øe, and being ≈øtill fru≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, afterwards proclaimed them Traytors: but the Hou≈øe of Commons ≈øet out a Declaration to the contrary. Thus His Maie≈øty being cro≈ø≈øed in his Princely intent, was ≈øomewhat perplexed hereupon in his vexarious thoughts, which cau≈øed his iu≈øt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and partly for this cau≈øe, and partly for the dayly tumults, and confu≈øive nprores in the City, His Maie≈øtie departed from We≈øtmin≈øter to Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Court, with the Queen, Prince, and his Royall Progenie: having at the lea≈øt two or three hundred men guarding them, everie man with a brace of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolls. God grant that His Maie≈øtie may returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to the pre≈øervation of peace, and tranquillitie in the Kingdome. <hi>Amen.</hi>
